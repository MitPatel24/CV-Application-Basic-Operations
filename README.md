# Exploring Image Processing and Computer Vision Techniques 📸

##### *A Gradio-Powered Application with Interactive Controls*
---

## 📜 **Project Description**
This project is an interactive application powered by Gradio, showcasing a variety of image processing and computer vision techniques. Users can upload images, apply transformations, segment images, and even perform edge detection — all through an intuitive interface.

## 📂 **Features**  
- 🖼 Image upload and preview
- 🧾 Binarization: Convert images to binary format
- ✨ Noise Reduction: Smooth images using Gaussian blur
- 📏 Resize and Compress: Adjust dimensions or file size
- 🎨 Image Segmentation: Cluster pixels into meaningful groups
- 🔄 Image Transformations: Translation, Rotation, Scaling, Shearing, Reflection
- ⚡ Edge Detection: Sobel and Canny methods for edge detection
- 📊 Interactive controls for real-time adjustments
